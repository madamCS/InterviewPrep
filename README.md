# Coding Interview Prep

_Snippets of how I prepare for technical coding interviews._

## About
Most of the practice problems I do come from [Cracking the Coding Interview][cracking-code], which is probably the most
popular tool to prepare for technical interviews.
I've separated my problems by type (differing data structures, algorithms, etc.), and they are al written in C, my preferred
coding interview language.
